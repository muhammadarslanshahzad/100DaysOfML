    "A lot of classification models like logistic regression were originally designed for binary classification, that is predicting whether something is one thing or another. For datasets with more than two classes, what do you do? For multiclass classification problems, one approach is to split the task into multiple binary classification datasets and fit a binary classification model on each. In this video, we will explore the One-vs-Rest strategy and how you can apply it to logisitic regression using Scikit-Learn."
